  I am a gigging jazz singer, specializing in the crooner-style and Sinatra
  covers. I also excel in musical theater styles. I trained under opera singer
  and choral director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsibulo">Jerome S&iacute;bulo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Since 2019, I am a member of the
  <a href="https://denverchoruses.org/">Denver Gay Men's Chorus</a>, and its a
  cappella ensemble <em>Off Kilter</em>. I am a frequent soloist in both.

<p>
  Through college, I participated in an <em>a cappella</em> group called
  <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org">In the Buff</a>. I was their Music Director
  for the 2018-2019 school year, in which we recorded
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Wl6rb7Uy4jUFJ1ZSLMpeJ">an album</a>
  and organized our 25th anniversary concert.
</p>
<p>
  In 2015, I participated in the Colorado All State Jazz choir, where I trained
  under Kerry Marsh and Julia Dollison. In 2014, I attended jazz camp at
  <a href="https://www.unco.edu/pva/music/areas/jazz-studies/">UNC Greeley</a>,
  also led by Marsh and Dollison. I sang the standards at a monthly jam session
  called <em>Boulder Friends of Jazz</em> throughout high school.
</p>

<h2>Drag</h2>
<p>
  I perform in drag under the name <em>Jacob Sparkles-LeCher</em>, and I
  specialize in live vocals. I reigned as Mx. Gay Pride of All Colorado 2024-2025,
  and I have volunteered with the Imperial Court of the Rocky Mountain Empire as
  a drag performer.
</p>
<p>
  I have experience making live vocal drag mixes by stringing together karaoke
  tracks, or removing vocals from songs that don't have instrumental versions.
  If you're a drag performer who would like help with that, reach out!
</p>

<h2>Piano</h2>
<p>
  I am a gigging jazz pianist, trained under pianist and singer-songwriter
  <a href="https://linktr.ee/mak.dooley">Makayla Dooley</a>. I frequently play
  for a showtunes "piano karaoke" event called Musical Mondays in Denver.
</p>

<h2>Songwriting & Music Production</h2>
<p>
  I've been developing a stage musical since 2021. I can't share too much about
  it yet, but feel free to reach out and ask me anything!
</p>
<p>
  During the COVID-19 lockdown, I started a project where I picked a climactic
  moment from a TV show/movie and wrote a showtune about it. These, along with
  any other karaoke tracks or dinky little chiptunes I made, are available on my
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrjacobbloom">SoundCloud</a>.
</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>
  I've amassed a bit of a following on my
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JacobBloom">YouTube channel</a>, where
  I occasionally post karaoke tracks, ukulele tutorials, or school projects.
  I also have a decent following on
  <a href="https://www.smule.com/mrjacobb">Smule</a>, an online karaoke app.
</p>

<p>
  I've been involved in community theatre since I was little. Some of my recent
  roles include Mark in <em>Rent</em> and Anthony in <em>Sweeney Todd</em>. For
  more details, see my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1MnVua9W5gWxaA0VLZr1_GXr2HrGKW2cXk2l_rN9-M/edit?usp=sharing">theatre r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.
