      <p>
        Hey, I'm Jacob!
        Iâ€™m a fun, energetic, resourceful programmer with a passion for
        JavaScript. I'm finishing up a degree in Computer Science at University
        of Colorado Boulder. I have egregious levels of experience in both
        client- and server-side JS, and I have over a year of experience in
        ServiceNow administration and development under CU's IT department. I'm
        well-versed in a few other languages and pick up new ones quickly!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a musician. This year, I've taken over as music director for my
        <em>a cappella</em> group, <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org">In the
        Buff</a>. This year is our 25th anniversary and we're finishing up
        recording an album. Check out ITB's website and social media for updates
        on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dabble in music production
        on my own, which you can hear for yourself on my
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrjacobbloom">SoundCloud</a>. I've
        played piano since I was little and I'm often involved in community
        theatre.
