This is my website. It runs on wintersmith and nunjucks, which compile it into a static site for github pages. You may need to change the variable "url" in config.json to make assets work--and remember to change it back after!

## building
```
cd src/
wintersmith preview
wintersmith build -o /Users/.../mrjacobbloom.github.io
```

## credits
- The background image is from https://trianglify.io/
- I used MuseScore for the sheet music graphics
- I use a lot of Google Fonts. Thanx Google :raised-hands:
- I use Font Awesome throughout this site. (but no jQuery so at least I can brag
  about my ability to write vanilla JS)
