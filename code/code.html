  I'm a fun, energetic, resourceful programmer with a life-long passion for
  JavaScript, CSS, and TypeScript. I love collaborating with a team, mentoring
  junior developers, and building systems that are intuitive, well-documented
  and well-tested. I spent 5 years working with React and the MERN stack as a
  full-stack developer at <a href="http://anark.com/">Anark</a>.
