      <p>
        Hey, I'm Jacob!
        Iâ€™m a fun, energetic, resourceful programmer with a passion for
        JavaScript. I have egregious levels of experience in both client- and
        server-side JS, and I'm currently putting that knowledge to the test
        at my job with <a href="http://anark.com/">Anark</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a musician. Since 2019, I've sung with the Denver Gay Men's
        Chorus. Before that, I sang with a college <em>a cappella</em> group
        called <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org">In the Buff</a>. I served as
        their music director for my senior year of college (which was also their
        25th anniversary) and worked on an album with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dabble in music production
        on my own, which you can hear for yourself on my
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrjacobbloom">SoundCloud</a>. I've
        played piano since I was little and I'm often involved in community
        theatre.
