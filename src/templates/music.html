  My name's Jacob and I've been involved in musical performances all my life.
  I'm a singer, pianist, and amatuer music producer. Some of my work and
  accomplishments are detailed below.
</p>
<h2>A Cappella</h2>
<p>

  Since my freshman year of college, I've been involved in an <em>a
  cappella</em> group called <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org">In the Buff</a>.
  This year I've taken over as Music Director, which has been a whirlwind but
  I'm enjoying it and we sound as great as ever!
</p>
<p>
  ITB has a lot of irons in the fire right now. We turn 25 this year, and our
  anniversary concert is going to be one of the biggest events we've put on in
  years! We're also putting the finishing touches on our 6th album, which we're
  releasing this year.
</p>
<p>
  Getting involved in <em>a cappella</em> was hands-down the best decision I've
  made in college. I met my closest friends through a cappella. It's something
  that I get to look forward to throughout my week and it's where I feel most at
  home.
</p>
<h2>Music Production</h2>

<p>
  I dabble a little in music production from time to time. I enjoy crafting
  predictable, full-sounding music that relies heavily on repeated melodic
  patterns. I get plenty of mileage out of chip noises and cheap MIDI synths,
  which I use to create kitsch, synthesized music meant to evoke a neo-Nintendo
  nostalgia for the listener. I've posted some of my work on my
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrjacobbloom">SoundCloud</a> if you're
  interested in experiencing it for yourself.
</p>
<h2>Theatre</h2>
<p>
  I've been involved in community theatre as long as I can remember. Some of my
  recent roles include Mark in <em>Rent</em> and Anthony in
  <em>Sweeney Todd</em>. For more details, see my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1MnVua9W5gWxaA0VLZr1_GXr2HrGKW2cXk2l_rN9-M/edit?usp=sharing">theatre r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.
</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
I've played piano since I was little. I'm into jazz as well! Once a month, I sing the stadards at a jam
session called <strong>Boulder Friends of Jazz</strong>.
