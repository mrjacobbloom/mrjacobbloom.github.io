  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, I'm Jacob!
    Iâ€™m a fun, energetic, resourceful programmer with a passion for
    JavaScript. I have egregious levels of experience in both client- and
    server-side JS, and I'm currently putting that knowledge to the test
    at my job with <a href="http://anark.com/">Anark</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also a musician. Since 2019, I've sung with the Denver Gay Men's
    Chorus. Before that, I sang with a college <em>a cappella</em> group
    called <a href="http://www.inthebuff.org">In the Buff</a>. I served as
    their music director for my senior year of college (which was also their
    25th anniversary) and worked on an album with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I dabble in music production
    on my own, which you can hear for yourself on my
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrjacobbloom">SoundCloud</a>. I've
    played piano since I was little and I'm often involved in community
    theatre.
