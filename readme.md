This is my website. It runs on wintersmith and nunjucks, which compile it into a static site for github pages. You may need to change the variable "url" in config.json to make assets work--and remember to change it back after!

The background image is a modified version of a free image from subtlepatterns.com so I didn't feel obligated to credit them on the site itself but yeah

I use at /least/ two copies of Font Awesome throughout this site. (but no copies of jQuery so at least I can brag about my ability to write vanilla JS)
